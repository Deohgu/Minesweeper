# Minesweeper
A minesweeper game developed using in React.js coupled with Styled Components.

---

The app has been developed due to my love for minesweeper and to be able to work on challenging algorithms such as optimizing searches in a matrix, and working out solutions that enable features such as an easy start, guess free game, and so on.

In the future I intend on developing a minesweeper solver.
