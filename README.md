# Overview  

<br>

### What is it?

A Minesweeper Web Application clone of the Windows 98 version.  
The game is being developed using React.js coupled with Styled Components.  
Despite being under development is it already functional and the on-going work can been seen in [projects](https://github.com/Deohgu/minesweeper/projects/1).

<br>

### Why was it built?

The app has been developed from scratch mostly as a playground for learning.  
New features will be added over time, so far I have developed :

- An algorithm that randomly assigns states to a 2D array
- An algorithm that goes through a 2D array and conditional operates based on the states of each Cell
- An accurate timer built with vanilla JavaScript

<br>

### Future Features?

- Easy start option
- Guess Free game option (game can be completed without having to guess)
- Infinite Scrolling game mode
- Minesweeper solver/probability calculator
